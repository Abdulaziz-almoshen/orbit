# Changelog

All notable changes to the `orbit` plugin are documented here. The version here
must match `VERSION` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — the update checker compares them.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

- `/orbit` skill: audits any product repo and scaffolds the full self-prompting
  system — `CLAUDE.md` persistent memory, `.orbit/STATE.md` working state, a specialized
  sub-agent team, domain skills, the read→act→evaluate→update→decide loop, and hard stop
  conditions.
- Hybrid output: a model-agnostic core (`loop.py`, `loop.config.json`, role specs, skills)
  plus a Claude Code adapter (`.claude/agents`, hooks, `ralph_loop.sh`).
- Domain-agnostic: characterizes whatever product it runs in via the universal profile.
- Self-update: a preamble update-check on every invocation, plus `/orbit-upgrade`
  (git-based pull-and-continue, with auto-upgrade config and snooze).
